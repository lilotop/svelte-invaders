# 🧭 Roadmap
## ShotsManager
> Resume store logic 

> Add UI component that will do a `#each` on the store and will generate UI elements accordingly, leveraging the transition effect of svelte (like done in TODO lists) to move shots smoothly to their new position.

> Add the `add` api usages in defender and in AlienGrid

> Add a `remove(id)` api to remove shots after they hit or go offscreen



## AlienGrid

## ⏬
> Also move downword

## ↔
> Grid width should be calculated according to existing aliens

## ↕
> Grid height should be calculated according to existing aliens

## 🏃‍♀️ 
> Speed should be changed dynamically depending on num of aliens remaining

# 🐞 Known bugs
## Refreshing in game page causes weird jump of playfield
- Doesn't happen when moving to game page from home page, so it is probably related to the window's init delay.
